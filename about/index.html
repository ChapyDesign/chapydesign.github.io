      <h2>Who is Chapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Michael Chapman, also known as Chapy, is an Art Director, Designer, and emerging MML developer whose creative roots trace back to his upbringing in San Diego, California. Raised in the heart of action sports culture, he was shaped by the visual world of surf, skate, moto, and street art that surrounded him.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		His earliest design inspiration came from road trips along Interstate 5, where graffiti murals, bold semi-truck branding, and the expressive artwork of action sports became his first visual language. A major turning point came at age 14, when rapidly progressing scoliosis led to spinal surgery. The shift away from sports pushed him deeper into art, where he found direction and purpose.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Before formally studying design, Chapman worked across several craft-driven roles—retail, product buying, labor, professional bodyboard shaping at The Dojo in La Jolla, and four years of woodworking at Roger’s Woodturning. These hands-on experiences formed the foundation of his precision, work ethic, and understanding of materials.
	  </p>
      <p>
		In 2006 he committed fully to his creative path, earning a Bachelor of Science in Graphic Design from The Art Institute of California – San Diego. After graduating with honors in 2009, he entered the industry in a Vista manufacturing company, then moved into action sports roles at Dye Precision/Pro-Tec and later Riviera Paddlesurf, where he spent seven years designing products, print assets, marketing campaigns, and digital experiences.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Chapman is now the Art Director at Independent Trading Co., where he balances creative direction with hands-on execution across apparel development, brand identity, web design, packaging, trade show environments, and collaborative campaigns.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Today, Michael “Chapy” Chapman blends decades of multidisciplinary craft with modern digital innovation, including his growing work in MML (Metaverse Markup Language). His career reflects resilience, adaptability, and a lifelong passion for impactful, culturally informed design.
