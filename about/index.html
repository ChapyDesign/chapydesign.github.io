      <h2>Who is Chapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Michael Chapman, known professionally as Chapy (b. 1980), is an Art Director, Designer, and emerging MML developer whose creative path began long before his formal training. Growing up in San Diego, California, he was raised in the epicenter of action sports—surf, skate, moto, and street culture—and it shaped nearly every corner of his artistic world.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		His love for design sparked early. As a kid traveling up and down Interstate 5, he became mesmerized by the colorful graffiti murals, the bold branding splashed across semi-truck trailers, and the raw, dynamic artwork coming out of skateboarding and action sports. What most people saw as scenery, he saw as design language—loud, expressive, and alive.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		At 14, a major life shift pushed him even deeper into art. Diagnosed with rapidly progressing scoliosis, he underwent spinal surgery that disrupted his path toward sports but opened the door to new friendships, new perspectives, and ultimately a new lifelong devotion to creativity. Art became the outlet, the anchor, and eventually the career.
	  </p>
      <p>
		After high school, Chapman explored a series of hands-on jobs that would inform his craftsmanship and work ethic. He started in retail at Rancho Boardride Co. and Surfride, where he quickly worked his way into a buyer role for bodyboarding gear. He later took on short-term labor delivering doors to housing developments before stepping into an unusual but pivotal role—shaping professional bodyboards at The Dojo in La Jolla, a workshop producing boards for three leading bodyboard brands. For three years he learned precision, material behavior, and the subtleties of making functional products by hand.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Still seeking greater growth, he transitioned into woodworking at Roger’s Woodturning in Vista, developing his skills in manufacturing, tools, and craft over four years. But his pull toward design never faded. In 2006 he made the decisive leap—enrolling at The Art Institute of California – San Diego, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Graphic Design (2009). He graduated with honors and a renewed commitment to pursue design professionally.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Immediately after college, Chapman secured his first design role at a Vista-based manufacturing company, where he developed his foundation in graphic design, print production, and web design. He briefly joined Dye Precision / Pro-Tec in the action sports industry before landing a long-term role at Riviera Paddlesurf, where he spent seven years designing products, print materials, web experiences, and marketing assets for a fast-moving outdoor brand.
      </p>	  
	  <p>
		His experience and versatility eventually led him to Independent Trading Co., where he now works as Art Director—developing apparel, building websites, guiding brand direction, designing campaigns, and managing product development. His role blends creative strategy with hands-on execution across apparel, graphics, packaging, trade show environments, and cross-team collaboration.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Today, Michael “Chapy” Chapman blends decades of multidisciplinary experience—from street art influence to product design craftsmanship—with a modern focus on digital spaces, including his growing work in MML (Metaverse Markup Language). His journey reflects resilience, reinvention, and an enduring passion for bold, functional, and culturally rooted design.
