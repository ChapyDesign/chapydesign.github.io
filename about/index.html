      <h2>Who is Chapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Michael “Chapy” Chapman (b. 1980) is an Art Director, Designer, and emerging MML developer based in San Diego, California. Raised in the heart of surf, skate, and action-sports culture, his early inspiration came from graffiti along Interstate 5, bold branding on semi-trucks, and the expressive visual style of skateboarding.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		A major scoliosis diagnosis and spinal surgery at age 14 shifted his path away from sports and deeper into art, solidifying design as both outlet and direction. Before formal training, he gained hands-on experience across retail, bodyboard shaping, and woodworking, developing a strong foundation in craft, materials, and product thinking.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		He later earned his B.S. in Graphic Design from The Art Institute of California – San Diego (2009) and went on to build a diverse career across manufacturing, action sports, outdoor products, and apparel. His roles at Dye Precision / Pro-Tec and Riviera Paddlesurf expanded his expertise in product development, branding, web design, and creative direction.
	  </p>
      <p>
		Today, as Art Director at Independent Trading Co., Chapman leads apparel design, product development, brand strategy, digital experiences, and cross-team creative execution. He continues to explore emerging technologies, most notably MML, combining decades of multidisciplinary experience with a forward-looking approach to design.
